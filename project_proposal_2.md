## Project Title
Predictive Modeling for Health-Related Risk Assessment

## 1. Research Topic
Our research aims to develop predictive models for assessing health-related risks based on an individual's lifestyle, medical history, and demographic factors. We will utilize a comprehensive dataset from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) with 19 variables, including general health, exercise habits, disease history, and more. Our goal is to predict the likelihood of various health conditions, such as heart disease by analyzing the provided features.

## 2. SMART Questions
- Can we build accurate predictive models to determine an individual's risk of developing heart disease  based on their demographic, lifestyle, and medical history factors?
- How do different factors, such as exercise habits, alcohol consumption, and BMI, contribute to the prediction of health conditions?
- What is the impact of gender, age, and general health status on the risk assessment of various health conditions?

## 3. Data Source
We will use the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset, which is a nationwide survey that collects health-related information from U.S. residents. This rich dataset provides a wide range of variables that are crucial for health risk prediction.

## 4. GitHub Repository
Our project will be hosted on our team's GitHub repository, where we will share the code, data, and documentation related to the project. The GitHub repository link is [Link to our GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CharanReddyKumar/Cardiovascular_Diseases_Risk_Prediction).

## 5. Modeling Methods
For this project, we plan to use various machine learning and statistical modeling methods, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machines
- Naive Bayes

These methods will allow us to build predictive models that can classify individuals into risk categories for specific health conditions. 
We will evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 6. Expected Outcomes
Our project aims to create predictive models that can assist in personalized healthcare by identifying individuals at higher risk of specific health conditions like heart disease. These models can potentially revolutionize healthcare by enabling targeted interventions, early disease prevention, and improved healthcare resource allocation.
